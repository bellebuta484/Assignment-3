I am currently studying a Bachelor of Business (Supply Chain and Logistics). Since Covid19 outbreak I decided to scale back on my full-time role as a National Fleet Manager for Hertz and focus on completing my degree. Studying through Open Universities has allowed me to pace my studies however this has been slow with a demanding job. I am now aiming to finish my degree in May 2021. I grew up on a farm and enjoy horse riding, camping, travelling, and spending time with my dogs. I also sing and play guitar in my spare time (cheaper than therapy)

# Group Processes 

The Group worked well as a team in assignment 2 with individual tasks being allocated to team members. The following processes worked well for assignment 2 and will remain in assignment 3 

Use of a detailed action list – This list clearly breaks down the components of the assignment, marks awarded to these sections and allocates the task to an individual team member. Team members are allocated to tasks collaboratively through self-nomination and during team meetings.  

Due dates were added to tasks to ensure the team remained on target to meet submission deadline. 

Working of the same document. A report template was created and uploaded to Microsoft Teams. All formatting, font etc was the same to ensure submission clean-up was quick and easy. 

Regular meetings were conducted on a Tuesday and Thursday in the evening with all members attending majority of the time.  

In order to facilitate a better result in Assignment 3 the following process improvements will be made 

At the start of each meeting each team member will explain the tasks they have performed at a high level so the whole team understands, and any questions will be raised at this time.  

Team members will provide feedback on other members work to ensure any missing components are covered. 

Any uncertainty in an element of the assignment will be immediately deferred to the course tutor by sending an email.
