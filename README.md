<p>I am currently studying a Bachelor of Business (Supply Chain and Logistics). Since Covid19 outbreak I decided to scale back on my full-time role as a National Fleet Manager for Hertz and focus on completing my degree. Studying through Open Universities has allowed me to pace my studies however this has been slow with a demanding job. I am now aiming to finish my degree in May 2021. I grew up on a farm and enjoy horse riding, camping, travelling, and spending time with my dogs. I also sing and play guitar in my spare time (cheaper than therapy)</p>

<h2>Group Processes</h2> 

<p>The Group worked well as a team in assignment 2 with individual tasks being allocated to team members. The following processes worked well for assignment 2 and will remain in assignment 3</p>

<p>Use of a detailed action list – This list clearly breaks down the components of the assignment, marks awarded to these sections and allocates the task to an individual team member. Team members are allocated to tasks collaboratively through self-nomination and during team meetings.</p> 

<p>Due dates were added to tasks to ensure the team remained on target to meet submission deadline.</p> 

<p>Working of the same document. A report template was created and uploaded to Microsoft Teams. All formatting, font etc was the same to ensure submission clean-up was quick and easy.</p> 

<p>Regular meetings were conducted on a Tuesday and Thursday in the evening with all members attending majority of the time.</p>  

<p>In order to facilitate a better result in Assignment 3 the following process improvements will be made </p>

<p>At the start of each meeting each team member will explain the tasks they have performed at a high level so the whole team understands, and any questions will be raised at this time.</p>  

<p>Team members will provide feedback on other members work to ensure any missing components are covered.</p> 

<p>Any uncertainty in an element of the assignment will be immediately deferred to the course tutor by sending an email.</p>

<h2>Tools  </h2>

<p>In order to create better communication, the team relied heavily on Microsoft Teams. The team discussed the minimal use of GitHub during assignment 2 and endeavoured to utilise it more in assignment 3 in order to gain exposure to the site. All members of the team did feel that Microsoft Teams facilitated better communication, greater efficiency and better report writing. All team meetings were conducted and recorded in Microsoft Teams as this is not an available option in GitHub. All meeting agendas and meeting minutes were easily prepared and uploaded using templates with minimal additional entries. It was easy to refer back to the meeting recording should any items need to be reviewed. The team felt that the use of GitHub did not facilitate the level of collaboration that Microsoft teams enabled as all documents needed to be created in a word document for ease and transferring this to Github would have been duplication of work and is an extremely inefficient process.</p>  

<p>The Team believed the most efficient, consistent and uniform way to manage the project was to heavily rely on Microsoft Teams as it enabled all members to use one platform for meeting, chat communication and document editing and allowed us to work of the same document at the same time. The use of word also allowed us to visualize the best format for the report which would then serve as the template for our HTML webpage. We used the Word document of our report to test how the website could look and then once we were happy with the format we coded to a HTML webpage in Github. The team noted that while Github was a useful tool for sharing code and working collaboratively on the coding elements of app development in order to ensure out virtual team worked as efficiently as possible we relied mostly on Microsoft Teams. </p>


  
<h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>  

<h3> Topic  </h3>

<p>Initially the project centred around the development of an all-in-one fitness app that allows people to track and monitor their fitness goals. This app would provide users with customizable workout plans, weight management goals and track calorie intake.  It would also track fitness goals by storing information on a large list of exercises such as, weightlifting (Including weight and reps), running, Pilates, swimming, yoga, rowing, stretching, and hiking etc. We aimed to build an app that would meet existing shortfalls in similar products, however given the time constraints we limited these to a few key elements with the remaining to be considered in later versions. We had originally attempted to include an extensive list of items such as tailored workout programs, the ability to stream workouts and store nutritional information however given the restrictive timeline and the team only consisting of 2 members we drastically reduced the scope. </P> 

<p>We first aimed to set a realistic time frame for the project from concept to launch. To do so we developed 9 distinct phases to cover a 15 week period for app development. These phases were broken down into 1. Concept definition, 2. Need Analysis, 3. Design, 4. Choosing Technology, 5. App Development, 6. Internal functionality testing, 7. User Acceptability testing, 8. Launch and 9. Support. Given the scope the project outlined in the following report led the team to the very start of the app development stage the 6 weeks covered phases 1 – 4 with the remaining phases to be carried out in the subsequent 10 weeks. The aim by the end of this project was to have defined the concept, determined key features for version 1.0 of the app, design mock ups of the user interface, research all available technologies (including software and hardware) and determine the most suitable options for app development and enter the very early stages of app development </p>  
</div>
 

<h3> Motivation </h3>

<p>Each team member currently uses a health and fitness app daily and felt that there were considerable shortfalls in these apps that required additional subscriptions or didn’t meet all our personal requirements. Examples discussed included apps such as Samsung health included upgrades that removed certain useful functions such as the “Weight Management Tracker” that logged calories in and out and provided users with a daily calorie balance. Certain apps such as MyFitnessPal had limited functionality to enter detailed exercise information such as weight and reps for weight-based workouts. The team wanted to develop an app that appealed to those who are familiar with fitness apps and health trackers in the 25-45 year age demographic to provide a full lifestyle app that covered all areas of health and fitness tracking including weight management, calorie tracking, fitness tracking, sleep tracking etc to offer a broader scope than existing offerings.</p> 

<h3>Landscape </h3>

<p>As of October 2020, Statista.com reported that there were approximately 47,140 various medical health apps available for download on Google Play. These range from simple step trackers and calorie counters to meditation and workout apps. During the 1st quarter of 2020, health and fitness apps were downloaded 593 million times, an impressive 33% higher than the 1st quarter in 2019 (Statista, 2020). The rapid increase in health and fitness app downloads has been driven the COVID19 pandemic, where people were confined to their homes and turned to in home fitness solutions. These figures are anticipated to grow as further gym closures and lockdowns are inevitable. Forbes listed the top 10 health and fitness lifestyle apps in 2020 as follows; </p>

<p>1.Calm: 8.6 million installs </p>

<p>2.Fitbit: 4.8 million installs</p> 

<p>3.MyFitnessPal: 3.9 million installs </p>

<p>4.Headspace: 3.8 million installs</p> 

<p>5.Flo: 3.6 million installs </p>

<p>6.Muscle Booster Workout: 3.4 million installs</p> 

<p>7.BetterMe: 3.2 million installs </p>

<p>8.Fitness Coach: 2.9 million installs </p>

<p>9.Samsung Health: 2.8 million installs </p>

<p>10.Home Workout - No Equipment: 2.7 million installs </p>

<p>It was important to note that apps that contained video workouts were downloaded 65% more than non-video based workout apps and also had 40% more active daily users and were able to generate 15% more revenue (Koetsier, 2020). Many of these apps focus heavily on a specific criteria, Fitbit, MyFitnessPal, Fitness Coach, Home Workout and Muscle Booster workout focus on improving fitness through exercise and offer a plethora of video workouts through the app. Apps such as Better me and Flo are targeted towards women’s health specifically. </p> 


<h2> PROJECT DETAILS </h2> 

<h3> Aim  </h3>

<p>The primary aim of this project is to produce a health and fitness app that meets the specific requirements of the target audience. These requirements are to manage weight loss and weight maintenance, set specific food intake goals and track calories and macronutrient intakes and set exercise goals and track physical performance. In order to achieve our overarching, aim we developed a list of tangible goals to support the development of our mobile app over the 15 week period as follows: </p>

<p><b>Define Scope</b>  : While the aim is to build an all-encompassing health and fitness app the 15 week timeframe will not allow for all desired items to be made available in the 1.0 release. Therefore, a thorough need analysis will be carried out to prioritise all desired features. All potential app features will be prioritised with the most important being included in the initial release and further features being listed for later 2.0 and 3.0 releases. This will ensure the size of the project is more manageable, focus is maintained, and a viable product is available for release by the end of the 16 weeks.</p>

<p><b>Create a user-interface design</b> : Although design may be considered a final step in the process, the design of a mobile app is imperative to the customer experience. Complicated features and nuanced technical details will determine the databases and programming languages however the customer experience is key to the success and usability of an app. This can only be reached with a design that facilitates ease of use and creates positive engagement with the customer. Developing a simple easy to use interface design first will assist in creating customer loyalty and retention throughout later releases of the app. Presentation, usability and simplification will ensure the apps success.</p> 

<p><b>Choose the right software</b> : The technology chosen for our mobile app development will determine how the app is developed and how users interact with it. Selecting the wrong technology can be a costly mistake, resulting in inaccessibility or poor performance (Haynes, 2021). The team will look at the pros and cons of native vs web apps, programming languages, app development sites and database software to ensure all avenues are explored to find the most suitable application available.</p>

<h3> Plans and Progress. </h3>

<p> In order to ensure we planned our time efficiently and had a clear concise idea of how our project would be managed the first step we undertook was to research the phases involved in Mobile App development and the time each phase would reasonably take to complete. We developed the following Mobile App Project Phase Pipeline to aid in adequate project management.</p> 

<p><img alt="" src="images/TimelinesOneGoal.jpg " /></p>


<h3> 1. Define Concept </h3>

<p>The first step on our project was to discuss our motivation for a mobile app, clearly define the overall concept and its viability in the marketplace. Our original motivation came from the teams collective desire to access a health and fitness mobile app that met our requirements as we felt current offerings fell short We conducted some market research on the viability of a health and fitness app based on current and forecasted market demand. Research indicates that the Mobile Health apps were set to benefit from the COVID19 pandemic and expected to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 31.25% between 2020 and 2026 (Global News Wire, 2021). Global News Wire (2021) reported that Asia Pacific was expected to experience the highest CAGR of 33.46% to 2026. This indicates that mobile health app development in the Asia Pacific region would meet consumer demand and possibly prove a profitable venture. </p>

<p>In order to capitalise on the mobile app the team decided on creating a landing page as a promotional tool to ensure marketing functions were a key tool throughout the design and development process. This would also aid in lead generation and target markets when the mobile app was launched. A simple promotional landing page was developed using Google Sites. It outlined the basic information for our App and asked potential users to enter their contact information. This would generate a database of potential customers that would be targeted during the launch phase. This worked well and the team agreed on the concept and developed the landing page in the early phases of app development. The teams landing page can be accessed at ONE GOAL Landing Page (See Appendix 1). We used a simple easy to use template available via Google sites. It was easy to use and simple development only took a few hours.  The concept was finalised before moving to the next step.</p> 

<h3> 2. Need Analysis (Scope and Limitations) </h3> 

<p>A critical step in the development process was to determine what key features and requirements were going to be achievable in the 15 week development timeframe. Given the limited timeframe it was unreasonable to assume we would be able to include all desired features in the initial release. To determine what features would be pertinent to usability and design in an initial release we listed all desired features and allotted a priority level of high, medium, and low. High level features were to be included in the initial release of the app. Medium Level features would be left for a 2.0 release and low-level features would be left for a 3.0 release or later. This would also ensure that the team remained focused on the key features for development and aided in time management.  Focusing on reasonable deliverables allowed the team to significantly reduce the scope of the initial release. The following table shows the pros, cons and final priority level allotted to each feature. </p>


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Feature</th>
    <th>Detail</th>
    <th>Importance to usability of App</th>
    <th>Priority Level</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Calorie Tracker</td>
    <td>Track Calorie intake daily. Initial Goal was to use an official food composition database and link the data into the app via API. This will ensure any updates to the food database are respectively updated in the mobile app regularly (i.e. as new products become available in Australian Supermarkets)</td>
    <td>As the weight management aspect of the app was discussed as a key feature of our development and dietary intake is an integral part of most health and fitness apps this is an absolute must.</td>
    <td>High</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Activity Tracker</td>
    <td>Tracks All non-traditional physical activity such as housework and gardening</td>
    <td>This would be an important feature to those who do not engage in much formal traditional exercise as it can certainly contribute to calories burned however as the app is primarily designed to be targeted to those who already use a health and fitness app the assumption is that most users engage in regular exercise. It is therefore not pertinent to initial release</td>
    <td>Medium</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Exercise Tracker</td>
    <td>Tracks all exercises such as rowing, running, weightlifting, stair climber, elliptical machine etc</td>
    <td>As we assumed most users would be engaging in regular exercise this would be one of the key features to introduce in an initial release</td>
    <td>High</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sleep function</td>
    <td>Tracks sleep</td>
    <td>Studies show that adequate sleep is imperative to effective weight loss so tracking sleep and providing users with information on sleep patterns is vital to support the weight management function. This however will not be a vital feature for initial release as it is simply a recording mechanism</td>
    <td>Low</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Water Intake</td>
    <td>Tracks water intake. Set water intake goals per day (Default set to 2 litres)</td>
    <td>This is a simple recording tool that will recommend daily water intake and track. This will be a relatively simple feature to develop however will not be vital in an initial release</td>
    <td>Medium</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Weight Management Function</td>
    <td>Upon entering current weight and goal weight and level of exercise etc, the app will determine the required calorie intake needed. This will be based on a Basic Metabolic Rate formula and estimated daily calorie burn to generate a calorie deficit.</td>
    <td>This is the most important feature of the app as it is the one feature that sets the mobile app apart from most of the other popular apps available. It will be developed with simplicity as a key design feature to aid in the user experience.</td>
    <td>High</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Step Trackers</td>
    <td>Tracking all steps</td>
    <td>This will aid in determining level of physical activity output and calorie burn. This feature will support the weight management and exercise features and is therefore imperative to initial release.</td>
    <td>High</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Workout Plan</td>
    <td>Basic workout plans can be accessed by selecting interest areas (such as strength training, flexibility etc). These will then upload template plans based on chosen interests.</td>
    <td>This will be a key feature moving forward however development of this feature will require considerable effort and will not be available in 1.0 release</td>
    <td>Medium</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Exercise Videos</td>
    <td>Research indicates that the most successful health apps include workout videos. The aim of this feature would be to link into the workout plan and be used as a tool. These would be provided most likely by external partners which would be linked in a seamless manner</td>
    <td>As this is closely tied into the workout plan function it is not to be included in the initial release.</td>
    <td>Medium</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Personal Profile Page</td>
    <td>Basic information holding name, age, weight, height, level of activity, average steps, average calorie intake etc, photo (if desired)</td>
    <td>This will be imperative to capturing data for marketing purposes and will provide users with a high level summary of their current goals and progress</td>
    <td>High</td>
  </tr>

<h3> 3. Design </h3>

<p>Design is the most important aspect of the initial mobile app development stages as it will dictate how all other workflows engage with each other. A recent Forbes article highlighted that simple user interface design flaws in a Citi app designed to transfer funds created an environment that allowed 3 Citi employees to sign off on transferring $900M to a creditor instead of the correct $7.8M (Forbes, 2021). User Interface design is key to the overall success and viability of a mobile app. User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design are possibly the most important step in mobile app development as it will define the blue print for software development. To engage and retain customer we developed a design mock-up of the following: </p>

<p>Sign Up Page: Basic Page when logged out of profile or opening for the first time after download </p> 

<p>Personal Profile Page: This include all information on the user such as name, email address, weight, age, height, fitness level etc.  </p> 

<p>Home Page: Opening page of the App. This will show name, photo, and loaded features such as Weight Management App, Calorie Counter, Activity and Step Tracker. The user can customise the view by moving the features up or down the page </p> 

<h3> 4. Choose Technology </h3>

<p>To aid in choosing the right technology we invested time into looking at all available technology and tools options. Like our need analysis we viewed a number of available technology and tools, listing pros and cons to aid in determining suitability to our project. The following table shows all software and hardware considerations. </p>  


<p>We followed the same colour scheme on from the Landing Page, using the same images to ensure continuity of design and start to create familiarity and brand recognition. These were developed using JUST IN MIND software that is designed to aid in UI prototype design. Examples as Follows</p>

<p>We decided upon using Appy Pie for Mobile App development. Appy Pie is a software that allows creating applications without coding. The method is relatively simple. It involves choosing a template and personalising it. The app can be for almost any business need, such as a small business, restaurant, real estate, or even a radio app. Once the app is complete, there are ways to distribute the app to the Google Play and Apple App stores. We choose this building site because the app is free, can be done in a minute, no coding skills require and updates in real-time.  AppyPie is easy to create a simple app in minutes. Basic features are decent and it's a good choice for small businesses like us. It's one of the rear app developer that offers to creating an app for free. Even thought the web app comes with ads. </p>

<p>We need a licence to create an app since the software is required to create the app, and the software would need a licence to use the software to be accepted. Licenses differ greatly, however. We may need to set up an account, pay one-time or annual fees, be limited to what can be created or how many copies can be selling, etc. </p>  

<p>For any company with publicly accessible applications, mobile app security assessments are important. It protects the customers and the organisation from potential disasters, trained cybersecurity experts may determine the strength of an application against known and potential threats. The proper tests will give the company a faith in the security of APIs and mobile apps. The security assessment reduces risks, save time, and enforce actionable protection measures to increase safety and comply with compulsory enforcement. </p> 


<h4>5.App Development</h4>

<P>The app development for our product through Appy Pie is divided into 4 stages as below.</p>

<P>Stage 1: Choose our app name. The name of our app is One Goal. It is reflected in our brand image as a fitness app.</p> 

<P>Stage 2: Select a colour scheme. Once the name has been decided, we are working on the colour of our app, and we choose Go Ocean as we believe in attracting the attention of the customers.</p> 

<P>Stage 3: Customise the app design. We believe that the way the app look is very important. We customise our app icon, font and colour and app layout to suit our target audience and readable for the app user.</p> 

<P>Stage 4: Choose the test device and install the app on the device. This is the most exciting part in building an app. As we get to see the actual app that go live and see the result of our efforts.</p> 

 

<h4>6. Internal Testing</h4> 

<p>Although Testing phases were not reached, we discussed the options for both internal testing and user interface testing. Application testing can be performed in different categories, such as GUI, features, database (backend) and load test. The testing lifecycles include different application testing stages, including requirement analysis, test preparation, test analysis, test design, test execution and bug reporting. There are four stages of a life cycle in Application Testing that we put in the project. </p>

<p>Design test plans based on specifications for applications.</p> 

<p>Develop manual test cases and scripts for automated testing.</p>  

<p>Verify application specifications, perform practical tests.</p> 

<p>Conduct load tests and tune the output of the application.</p>  

 

<h4>7. User Interface Testing</h4> 

<p>The landing page we created will capture interested parties and the google form on the landing page asked respondents if they would be willing to participate in user testing. Those that answered yes and had used a health and fitness app before would be chosen as Beta users. This would allow us to allocate a group with a vested interest in usability. Beta users would complete feedback forms, and one on one open forums to discuss usability of product and any usability issues.</p>  

 

<h4>8. Launch </h4>

<p>The Launch of the App would occur in the 15th week of development. Promotional material should have been released through partner sites prior to launch to generate interest. Prior to Launch the team would need to ensure the app is fully functional, all testing issues have been resolved and support staff are available at go live. Ensuring the App is available on Google Play and Apple Store platforms for download by consumers at the advertised date and time will be imperative. In the first week closely monitor customer feedback to gain insight into possible features in later versions and ensure technical issues are dealt with quickly </p> 

 

<h4>9. Support </h4> 

<p>Support of the app starts the day the app is launched. Technical issues would need to be trouble shooted and customer feedback would need to be very closely monitored in the weeks following a 1.0 release. At this stage the team would start working on features previously identified for a 2.0 release.</p> 

 

<h4>Roles</h4> 

<p>The allocation of roles was particularly difficult during this project as there were only 2 team members. This meant that we broke most of the tasks into two key areas. Project Management and planning, and technical development. Kristie acted more in a project lead capacity and oversaw all aspects of the project and provided direction. Kristie was responsible for the administration (preparing all documents and leading meetings etc), strategy, developing a build pipeline, developing design prototypes, report righting, and developing the landing page. Belle acted in the capacity of a technical developer and was responsible for the technical aspects and managed the GitHub Repository, researching available tools and technology, and the initial App development. Had more team members been available the roles would have involved allocation of less tasks but required further detail and development, or more specific roles been allocated however given the limited resources it was imperative that we rely on our strengths. Kristie’s strengths were leadership, strategy, planning and design while Belle's strengths were in technical development and coding. By splitting the tasks down the middle, the overall project become slightly more manageable.</p>  



<h4>Risks</h4> 

<p>For any company creating a mobile app, the worst nightmare: producing an app that their customers don't even want. Most companies fall into the pit of designing an application from their own viewpoint, not the customer's perspective. Spending thousands of dollars and months are needed for creating an app. If no one utilises the app, it's all wasted. When you approach the production of mobile apps from the wrong angle, this happens.  It is a good habit to seek feedback from consumers and consider what kind of feature and functionality they will be looking for in a mobile experience. Moreover, it would be useful to understand who our customer, age and gender.</p> 


<p>We see another problem on the opposite end of the spectrum: What happens if so many people start using your app? What if it takes off quicker than you'd ever anticipated? You could be trapped with hundreds of thousands of users helping you. Are you ready for that? A small team like us may build an app that is then used by thousands of people or even millions; providing service and support to increasing numbers of end-users is becoming entirely unscalable, leading to angry or confused end users who either leave a negative review of the App Store and/or remove the app. As with any modern technology, internal applications generate new burdens for IT to support users individually when they have problems. Via creating custom FAQs, using shared inboxes, bulk actions, and incorporating in-app help desks into the app, some solutions for both internal and external apps include automating the service and support method.</p> 

  
<p>Lastly, the security breaches are nothing new and extend to every site form or mobile app. The risk and vulnerabilities here lie in underestimating the need inside the apps for proper security precautions. Some businesses are making the mistake of thinking that automatically stable apps are and ignore proper security measures. Despite many of the same security vulnerabilities as web apps, many mobile developers believe that mobile devices are more secure by nature and do not go through the same security-vetting process as other applications. These weak security protocols, using attacks such as SQL injection, can lead to data compromises or even infrastructural breaches on the server-side.</p>

<h4>Group Processes & Communication</h4>

<p>The communication and group process in our team is through MS team sharing files, chats and 30 mins meetings twice a week. We divided the 6 people's work into 2 people as the team member were down from week one that we started the project. The complication of understanding and frustration was there, but we managed through and completes the project. We keep our communicating with our Unit Adviser, Anthony and our grader, Thomas. We managed a lot of organising the meeting, writing the report, Mockup the app design and the product page. We found numeral of the greatest resources on the internet, and we implemented them into our project.</p>

<h2>SKILLS & JOBS</h2>

<h3>GROUP REFLECTION </h3>

<h4>Personal Reflections </h4>

<p><b>Belle Phimonrat Panaphong</b></p>  

<p>We feel the short number of participants at the beginning of this assignment and left only 2 members to do this project. As we divided the work on the checklist, the progress did not end there. We gather the information that we need for our project contents. I must acknowledge that I was a little hesitant to take on assignments since there were so many. Fortunately, Kristie takes the lead and makes me feel more comfortable with the role I have been assigned to follow and complete. While we have so much workload to complete, I have found plenty of opportunities to learn how to use application building platforms such as Appy Pie, Just In Mind and Swing2app. During the research, I found it very simple and straightforward to create an app as there are lots of free tools available online, easy to use and free. Although it was a shame that there are only two people to do this assignment; otherwise, we could use more ideas from other team members that were down. The communication during this assignment was excellent. Kristie very well organises and well prepares, and easy to work with. </p>  

<p><b>Kristie Magazinovic</b></p> 

<p>Due to the limited resources available to the team with only 2 active team members the progress in development was slow. In hindsight we spent considerable time on the planning stage to determine role breakdowns, direction and create a timeline for the project. Unfortunately, we were only able to produce minimal tangible artifacts including a landing page for lead generation and design mock-ups to show UI/UX interface protypes. I personally found the building of the landing page and the interface design mock-ups to be an interesting experience. Throughout the project it became apparent that simple apps can be developed with user friendly software and require minimal coding. In a corporate setting this may change however having used AppSheet before it was good to have a look through AppyPie and see the differences. In group perspective I have learned that moving forward I possibly need to provide more clear and concise direction to other team members and more clearly articulate my approach to avoid confusion. Communication was fantastic with Belle and I think this is the only area that benefited form only have 2 team members as we were able to create a stronger connection. A project of this size would require a larger group to ensure more progress is made on actual development. Had the group been larger it would have been great to set the team up as a proper development team and allocate formal roles such as Project Lead, UI/UX Designer and Back end Developer as this would have aided in the learning journey </p>3
